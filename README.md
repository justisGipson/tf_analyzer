terraform static analyzer


TODO:
1.	~~Custom Rule Configuration~~:
  - Allow users to define custom analysis rules through a configuration file (e.g., YAML or JSON).
  - Users can specify resource types, attribute patterns, and custom validation logic.
  - Load the custom rules from the configuration file and apply them during the analysis.
2.	~~Recursive Module Analysis~~:
  - Implement support for analyzing Terraform modules recursively.
  - Traverse the module hierarchy and analyze each module separately.
  - Provide a consolidated report of issues found across all modules.
3.	~~Variable Usage Analysis~~:
  - Enhance the unused variable analysis to consider variable usage across modules.
  - Identify variables that are defined but not used in any module.
  - Detect variables that are used but not defined in any module.
4.	Resource Dependency Analysis:
  - Analyze the dependencies between resources based on their references.
  - Build a dependency graph to identify any circular dependencies or missing dependencies.
  - Provide warnings for potential issues related to resource dependencies.
5.	Security Best Practices Analysis:
  - Implement checks for security best practices in Terraform configurations.
  - Analyze resource configurations for potential security risks (e.g., open security group rules, unencrypted data storage).
  - Provide recommendations for improving the security posture of the infrastructure.
6.	Compliance and Policy Enforcement:
  - Allow users to define compliance and policy rules based on their organization's requirements.
  - Check Terraform configurations against these rules to ensure compliance.
  - Generate compliance reports and provide actionable feedback for violations.
7.	Integration with External Tools:
  - Integrate the static code analyzer with popular tools like Terraform CLI, Terraform Cloud, or version control systems (e.g., Git).
  - Provide seamless integration options to run the analysis as part of the development or deployment workflow.
8.	Reporting and Visualization:
  - Generate detailed analysis reports in various formats (e.g., JSON, HTML, PDF).
  - Provide a summary of the analysis results, including the number of issues found, severity levels, and affected resources.
  - Implement a web-based dashboard for visualizing the analysis results and tracking progress over time.
9.	Performance Optimization:
  - Optimize the analysis process to handle large Terraform configurations efficiently.
  - Implement parallel processing or caching mechanisms to speed up the analysis.
  - Provide options to exclude certain directories or files from the analysis scope.
10.	Documentation and User Guide:
  - Create comprehensive documentation and a user guide for the static code analyzer.
  - Explain the purpose, installation process, configuration options, and usage instructions.
  - Provide examples and best practices for writing Terraform code that aligns with the analyzer's recommendations.
